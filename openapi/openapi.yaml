    "This is an online documentation for the data exchange format of the DRK-UC1 project.
    \n\n
    The Data Transfer Exchange Format for UC1 is an artifact that aims to provide a structured format for data transfer between different cultural platforms.
    \n\n

    The schemas build on and extend [Schema.org] (https://schema.org/), a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.
    New entities or attributes that do not exist in Schema.org are marked as such (extended entity or extended attribute). Please refer to Schema.org for more details 
    on Data Transfer Exchange UC1. 
    \n\n
    For a detailed visual representation of our Data Model schema, see our [Data Model Diagram](#operation/getDiagram).
    \n\n
    The Data Transfer Exchange Format can be served in its minimum viable format as a JSON file. Fields that are required are marked as such. 
    All other fields are optional.

    \n\n
    !!Work in progress!! This documentation is still under construction and will be updated regularly."
